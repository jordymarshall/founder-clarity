# Product Design Guide

## 1.0 Our Philosophy

Our design is not a series of subjective choices. It is a system guided by a core philosophy.

**1.1 Clarity through Subtraction:** Our primary goal is to reduce cognitive load. If an element, word, or animation does not serve a critical function, it must be removed. When in doubt, subtract.

**1.2 Velocity is a Feature:** The interface must be, and feel, instantaneous. Performance is a core part of the user experience. Interactions should be immediate, and animations must be purposeful, never decorative.

**1.3 Crafted, Not Assembled:** Every component, from a button to a modal, is considered and designed with care. We do not use default styles. We build with precision to create a cohesive, intentional experience that feels like magic.

**1.4 Keyboard-First:** The most efficient path is through the keyboard. The entire application must be navigable and operable without a mouse. UI controls are secondary to keyboard shortcuts.
